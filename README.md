# cs6362-project

Final project for cs6362: advanced machine learning 

**Motivating question**: How do Variational Causal Networks (VCNs) approximation of the posterior over Direct Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in causal structure learning
compare to the boostrapped estimation via improved Direct LiNGAM in high dimensional settings?
